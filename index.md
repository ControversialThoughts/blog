<h2> Welcome! </h2>

<h3> I truly think dialogue is the best way to develop a structured thought. This is because our reasonings are constantly put to the test by our listener (if it is an interesting one, of course), consequently we must dig deeper into our true understanding of the topic. Within a dialectic confrontation there will be questions to be answered, and we may have to strive to get our point of view across. This process enhances our understanding of what we actually think, and why. Indeed we often are not able to raise some key issues to ourselves, either because we think we are right or because it would be necessary to see things with a completely different mindset, which is extremely difficult, if not impossible. \
This only applies if our listener's ultimate goal is also to achieve a well-developed thought, and not to impose its point of view, which unfortunately rarely happens. As you will take the role of the listener, I will commit to this hypothesis, hoping that these lines will be read only by open-minded people. \
The most interesting things to discuss are the things we are certain about, but we actually don't know why. We lack a structured thought about them, because it is not easy to develop one. \
Therefore I would like to investigate on the origins of common sense, or more braodly of whatever thing is taught or commonly seen as "right" that however comes with no true explanation. You will understand what I mean when you will look at the topics below, the first one serves as an example. Try not to think of them with your usual bias, but instead ask yourself: "What am I relying on, to say that this is wrong?". If your answer is "Because it is so." or something like that, you are kindly invited to read my argumentation. You will reject the thesis anyway (just like I do!), but maybe you will begin to wonder if there are other things that we take for granted but we have no clear idea where they come from, or you will be able to adequately reply and show me the way to find inner peace :)
However recall that the main objective of this blog is to _learn_, and not to _teach_, both for you and for me. \
ALERT! The topics you will see in this blog are deliberately provocative. You should *NOT* take them seriously. </h3>
