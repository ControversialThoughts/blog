Smooth start, nothing too extreme, but this will be funny. And it is also something I really would like to understand in depth, because almost everyone takes it as an absolute truth. \
The main claim is that _democracy_ is not this great form of government, and it has some heavy drawbacks. Even as a concept, so in its ideal shape, not only as it is implemented nowadays. \
Let's start from the beginning, that is the definition of democracy. From our favourite source[^1], we can see that: "Democracy is a form of government in which the people have the authority to choose their governing legislation". Switching to the italian website, things get more radical: "system of government in which sovereignty is exercised, directly or indirectly, by the people". I already see many problems here. \
Side note: I am not the first to explicitly criticise democracy[^2]. Just to mention a notable predecessor, Plato discusses it in depth in his dialogue Πολιτεία (Republic). An historical excursus is out of the scope of this short post, so let's get down to business.

[^1]: Wikipedia, of course
[^2]: Yeah I know you know it. Well, at least you _should_ know it. Plato indeed thought the government should be led by intellectuals: better read some books if you want to rule the world. However it was just to be very clear, I don't steal credits.
